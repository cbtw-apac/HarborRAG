"""SharePoint site, drive and drive-item traversal over Microsoft Graph.

Resolves the configured site and drives, walks folders, and applies the query,
allowlist, size and extension filters to drive items. An item selected by ID
must sit inside the configured ``root_path``. Item endpoints come from
``drive_paths``, which validates item IDs; nothing here downloads content.
Free-text log and error messages name items by ID, never by file name; the
structured skip fields owned by ``skips`` still carry ``webUrl`` and path.
