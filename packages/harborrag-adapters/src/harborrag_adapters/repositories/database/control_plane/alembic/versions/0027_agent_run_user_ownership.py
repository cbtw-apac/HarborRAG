"""Own agent runs by the human, not by the credential that acted.

Migration 0024 made ``conversation_sessions``/``conversation_messages``
user-owned, but ``agent_runs`` -- whose foreign-key parent is that very
sessions table -- kept filtering ``(tenant_id, principal_id, session_id)``.
One service principal fronting several people therefore left ``session_id``
as the only separator, so a known or guessed run id let one human read,
checkpoint steps into, and *resume* another's run, replaying somebody else's
conversation into the model.

``user_id`` becomes part of the key (backfilled from ``principal_id``, which
stays stored purely for audit) and an identity index leading on
``(tenant_id, user_id, session_id)`` replaces the redundant single-column
tenant index. ``run_id`` remains the primary key, so the lookup-by-run path
is unchanged.
