# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Documents are re-chunked and re-embedded on their next ingestion, and the shipped
embedding model changes, so re-ingest every source in `force` mode
(`harborrag ingestions start PROJECT_ID/CONNECTION_ID --mode force`). The `harborrag`
commands are renamed to follow the HTTP API. Follow the
[upgrade guide](docs/users/upgrading.md) before upgrading; entries marked **Breaking** need
action.

### Added

#### harborrag-adapters

- Migration `0046` stores runtime settings overrides and an append-only revision log
- Migration `0047` stores a chat session's `project_id` and an answer's `mode`, `trace_id` and `feedback`
- Structure-aware splitting of oversized text: code at syntax boundaries, Markdown at headings and fences, prose at sentence ends
- Markdown code blocks record their language, and source code files keep their indentation and are chunked as code

#### harborrag-app

- `GET` and `PATCH /v1/admin/settings` and `GET /v1/admin/settings/schema` read and change runtime settings
- CLI commands that call the same operation as their HTTP route, with the same input, output and error codes: `me`, `projects list|get|create|update|delete`, `source-types list`, `connections list|get|create|update|delete|test`, `ingestions start|list|get|pause|resume|cancel|retry-failures`, `failures list|retry` and `settings schema|get|set`
- CLI global options `--tenant`, `-o/--output table|json|yaml`, `--profile`, `--config` and `-y/--yes`, with defaults from `HARBORRAG_TENANT_ID`, `HARBORRAG_OUTPUT`, `HARBORRAG_PROFILE` and the profiles in `~/.config/harborrag/config.yaml` (keys `tenant` and `output`)
- `harborrag ingestions start --wait` and `ingestions get --watch` follow a run and exit `8` when it ends `failed` or `cancelled`; `ingestions start --inline` runs the pipeline in the CLI's process without Temporal
- The CLI asks before a write into a tenant that holds no data, `config import --apply` included; `--yes` skips the question
- `harborrag doctor` lists the tenants that hold data and checks the services with the `/readyz` checks, Temporal included
- `make cli-reference` writes `docs/users/cli-reference/commands.md` from the CLI's help, the command registry and the OpenAPI export, with each command's HTTP route and the CLI-only and HTTP-only lists; a test fails when a command and its HTTP route drift apart or the page is stale
- `harborrag config import` and `harborrag config export` move runtime settings through a YAML file
- `harborrag doctor` validates `config/ingestion/chunking.yaml`
- `GET /v1/admin/failures` lists failed documents with `counts` per error category, and `POST /v1/admin/failures/retry` starts one retry run per original run
- HTTP chat and `harborrag chat` rerank their passages when `retrieval.rerank` is on for the session's project, or else the tenant; `PATCH /v1/admin/settings` and `harborrag config import` accept `retrieval.rerank: true` when the model catalog has a `rerank` section, and refuse it with `422 validation_error` otherwise

#### harborrag-core

- Runtime settings registry: `retrieval.top_k`, `retrieval.rerank`, `parsing.pdf_parser`, `chunking.max_tokens`, `ingestion.concurrency` and `models.embedding`, with tenant, project and connection levels
- `RetrievalRequest.rerank` asks retrieval to rerank its passages with the model catalog's `rerank` model

#### harborrag-mcp-server

- `vector_search` reads `retrieval.top_k` at tenant level as its default `top_k`; chat reads it at the level of the session's project

#### harborrag-runtime

- Cached settings provider that reloads on Postgres `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` and a 5-second revision poll
- The API seeds settings from `config/settings.yaml` on first start and logs `config_yaml_drift` afterwards
- Ingestion pins the run's settings and `settings_revision` at start; workers parse and chunk with them
- Chunk sizes, per-source profiles and the splitting strategy are configurable in `config/ingestion/chunking.yaml`
- **Breaking:** ingestion requires the code grammars; the worker images and the `local` and `production` installs include them
- Retrieval can rerank with the model catalog's `rerank` model: it fetches four times `top_k` passages (at most 100), keeps the first `top_k` in rerank order, and adds `rerank_score` to each result's metadata while `relevance` keeps the lane's similarity; a rerank provider error fails the retrieval

### Changed

#### harborrag-app

- **Breaking:** `GET /v1/admin/ingestions/{ingestion_id}/events` sends `run.status`, `stage.progress`, `document.failed` and `run.completed`, replacing `task.<id>.progress`, `.done` and `.control`:
  - frames carry integer ids, a `: ping` arrives every 15 s, and `Last-Event-ID` resumes the stream
  - the response opens at once, and the deadline from `api_stream_timeout_seconds` ends the stream with an `error` event `deadline_exceeded`
  - a pause or resume appears as a `run.status` with the new status (`queued`, `running`, `paused`); the final status, including a cancel, arrives in `run.completed.finish_reason`
  - reconnecting to an ended run with nothing after `Last-Event-ID` answers `204`
- **Breaking:** the chat session routes answer the explorer `Session` and `Message` shapes:
  - `POST /v1/chat/sessions` takes `title` and `project_id` (an unknown project is `422 reference_not_found`, `profile_id` is `422` until v2.1.0) and answers the `Session`; `greeting` is gone
  - `GET /v1/chat/sessions` answers `items` of `Session` with `next_cursor` and searches titles with `q`
  - `GET /v1/chat/sessions/{session_id}/messages` answers `items` of `Message` newest first, pages with `cursor` and `limit` up to 100, and leaves out answers cut short by a dropped stream
  - the routes take the tenant from `X-Tenant-Id` instead of `tenant_id`
  - new sessions get `ses_…` IDs and new messages `msg_…`; stored `session-…` sessions keep theirs
- **Breaking:** `POST /v1/chat/completions` answers on the explorer contract, with no alias for the old request or response:
  - the body takes `message`, `mode` (`classic` or `instant`; `advanced` and `auto` are `422 mode_unavailable`), `reasoning` (`off`), `project_ids` (one-off questions only), `connections`, `filters` and `stream`; the tenant comes from `X-Tenant-Id` and the key from the `Idempotency-Key` header only
  - the answer is `completion_id`, `session_id`, `trace_id`, `mode`, `answer`, `citations` (`[n]` markers numbered by first use) and `usage` with `cost_usd`
  - `prompt`, `tenant_id`, `idempotency_key`, `model`, `graph_search`, `project_id`, `outcome`, `refusal_reason`, `provider`, `provider_model`, `message`, `cost`, `latency_ms`, `retry_count`, `fallback_count` and `memory_persisted` are removed
  - leaving out `session_id` asks a one-off question that creates no session and is not stored; in a session, retrieval reads only the session project's connections at its `retrieval.top_k`, and the answer is stored with the question under `completion_id`
  - an empty project is `409 no_indexed_content` before any model call, a busy session `409 session_busy` at once, and a provider failure `503 llm_unavailable` with nothing stored
  - `instant` skips the scope-check model call and graph observation, and an out-of-scope request is an ordinary answer without citations
  - `stream: true` sends the finished answer as `response.started`, one `response.output_text.delta` and `response.completed`
- **Breaking:** `harborrag chat` calls `POST /v1/chat/completions` and prints the new answer; without `--session-id` it asks a one-off question, and `--session` and `--project` are now `--session-id` and `--project-id`
- **Breaking:** the CLI follows the HTTP API, with no alias for the old names: `source list|show|add|update|test|remove` are `connections list|get|create|update|test|delete`, `source sync` and `ingest start` are `ingestions start`, `ingest run` is `ingestions start --inline`, `ingest status` is `ingestions get`, `ingest wait|watch` are `ingestions get --watch`, and `ingest pause|resume|cancel` are `ingestions pause|resume|cancel`; an old name prints the new one and exits `2`
- **Breaking:** `ingestions start` and the `connections` commands take the connection ref `PROJECT_ID/CONNECTION_ID`, refuse a bare key such as `harborrag-workspace` with a hint, and no longer import `config/sources/connectors.yaml`; `--force-reprocess` is `--mode force`, and `--timeout`, `--batch-size`, `--document-concurrency`, `--run-id`, `--connection-id`, `--source-scope-id`, `--path`, `--pattern`, `--recursive`, `--attachments`, `--filters-json`, `--limit`, `--events` and `--refresh` are removed
- **Breaking:** CLI `--json` is `-o json` and prints the HTTP response body instead of `{"ok", "data", "error"}`; errors go to stderr as the HTTP error envelope, or one line in a table; exit codes follow the HTTP status: `2` bad input, `3` not found (no longer a `--timeout`), `4` conflict, `5` not allowed, `6` unavailable, `8` a followed run that failed or was cancelled, `130` interrupted
- **Breaking:** `harborrag projects update` replaces the project body like the `PUT`, so a field left out is cleared; `harborrag connections test` exits `0` when the check reports `ok: false`
- **Breaking:** `harborrag config export --output` is `--file`, and `harborrag doctor` drops `--json` and `--temporal`: it always checks Temporal and exits `6` when only a service check fails
- The CLI prints `harborrag: using repository checkout DIR` and `using project DIR` only when stderr is a terminal
- **Breaking:** chat completion failures and accounting change:
  - `503 dependency_unavailable` when the answer cannot be stored, `503 llm_unavailable` for an empty answer, and `422` for a whitespace-only `message`
  - `usage` adds up the scope check and the answer
  - an `Idempotency-Key` stays free after a failure before any model call, store and retrieval outages included
- **Breaking:** SDK chat: `ChatExecutionOptions.session_id` is optional, `project_id` became `project_ids`, and `mode`, `connections`, `filters` and `trace_id` are new; `chat_completion()` returns the explorer body and raises the turn's errors; `chat_answer()` yields the turn's events; `validate_chat_model`, `validate_chat_project` and `validate_completion_scope` are removed
- **Breaking:** every `/v1/admin/ingestions*` route answers the explorer `Ingestion` shape and the task shape is retired, reads need role `editor` and take the tenant from `X-Tenant-Id` (`?tenant_id` is removed), pause, resume and cancel answer `200` with the run, and `retry-failures` answers `202` with the new run
- Connection tests report `error_category` `secret_unavailable` when the API cannot read a secret, and say that an `env:` secret lives in the worker's environment
- `HARBORRAG_TEMPORAL_UI_URL` and `HARBORRAG_GRAFANA_URL` fill the `links` of an ingestion run
- `POST /v1/admin/ingestions` and `harborrag ingestions start` refuse a connection a run would reject, with `422 validation_error` naming each failing field, instead of starting a run that fails in the worker
- The CLI recognises a checkout by `config/sources/connectors.yaml`

#### harborrag-engine

- Long code chunks keep the names of the class and function they belong to, and are searchable by them
- The `default` and `concise` chat prompts ask the model to cite sources by their `[n]` number

#### harborrag-mcp-server

- The MCP server reads `config/mcp/server.yaml` and, with the file key store, `config/mcp/keys.yaml`

#### harborrag-runtime

- **Breaking:** `config/` is organised by domain (`sources/`, `ingestion/`, `graph/`, `models/`, `mcp/`) and every default path follows; a deployment that sets each `HARBORRAG_*_CONFIG_PATH` keeps working
- **Breaking:** `config/models/models.yaml` sends chat, embedding and reranking through one LiteLLM proxy gateway and reads `HARBORRAG_URL`, `HARBORRAG_API_KEY`, `HARBORRAG_CHAT_MODEL`, `HARBORRAG_EMBED_MODEL` and `HARBORRAG_RERANKER_MODEL` instead of a provider, model and API key per family
- **Breaking:** the shipped embedding model is the gateway's, in the embedding space `harbor-cohere-embed-v4`; its vectors have the same 1536 dimensions as before, so re-ingest every source in `force` mode
- **Breaking:** `HARBORRAG_INGESTION_TENANT_ID` is renamed `HARBORRAG_TENANT_ID` (setting `RuntimeSettings.tenant_id`) and also sets the API's default tenant, so the API, the workers and the CLI share one; the old name has no alias and stops startup
- **Breaking:** model variables with the `HARBOR_CHAT_`, `HARBOR_EMBED_` and `HARBOR_MEMORY_` prefixes, such as those the model smoke tests read, are renamed `HARBORRAG_CHAT_`, `HARBORRAG_EMBED_` and `HARBORRAG_MEMORY_`
- Config YAML files hold values only; their explanations moved to the configuration pages. `config/ingestion/parsers.yaml` keeps its comments because its bytes are the parser identity

#### Deployment

- The development worker mounts `config/` read-only like the API and the MCP server, so a configuration change needs a restart, not an image rebuild
- `config/sources/schedules.yaml` and `config/mcp/keys.yaml` are git-ignored; each ships as an `.example.yaml` beside it
- The `qdrant` extra of `harborrag-adapters` requires `qdrant-client>=1.17,<1.20` (was `>=1.10,<2`); the lock stays on 1.18.0
- `config/temporal.example.yaml`, `config/models.example.yaml` and `config/harborrag.example.yaml` are removed
- `env-example/.env.models.example` sets the five model gateway variables and keeps the direct-provider and other-proxy examples commented out

### Removed

#### harborrag-app

- **Breaking:** `harborrag init` and its scaffold templates are removed with no replacement; run the CLI from a repository checkout. Projects an earlier `init` created keep working through their `harborrag.yaml` or `--project DIR`
- **Breaking:** `harborrag retrieve` and every `harborrag topology` command, `topology summaries backfill`, `topology config validate` and `apply` and `topology indexing permissions-import` included, are removed; search with the MCP `vector_search` tool or `harborrag chat`

### Fixed

#### harborrag-adapters

- Chat history and `message_count` leave out the empty or whitespace-only assistant steps of 1.x agent turns, and migration `0047`'s downgrade waits at most 5 s for its locks on Postgres, like its upgrade

#### harborrag-app

- **Breaking:** `GET /v1/admin/settings/schema` answers `{"groups": [...]}` with a description per setting, `POST /v1/admin/failures/retry` answers `409 invalid_state` when no failure matches instead of `202` with a null `ingestion_id`, and `GET /v1/admin/failures` omits `total` unless `include_total=true`
- A connection's `stats.errors` counts the failed documents of its latest run, also after a cancel, and is `0` before any run
- A run whose Temporal workflow ended without recording it, such as one terminated in the Temporal UI, no longer blocks its connection with `409 already_running`, retry runs included: starting an ingestion, removing the connection and cancelling the run record it as `CANCELLED` or `FAILED` first
- Cancelling a retry run cancels its workflow and records the run as `cancelled`, instead of answering `503`; `pause` and `resume` on a retry run answer `409 invalid_state`
- Cancelling a running or paused run whose Temporal workflow is gone, such as one past the namespace retention, records it as `cancelled` with `error_category` `workflow_not_found`, over HTTP and with `harborrag ingestions cancel`, instead of answering `503` every time; a queued run that is not a retry run still answers `503`
- `POST /v1/admin/ingestions` with an `updated_after` that has no UTC offset answers `422 validation_error` on `updated_after`, instead of `500`
- `harborrag ingestions pause`, `resume` and `cancel` follow the HTTP rules: pausing a paused run, pausing or resuming a retry run, and any action on a finished run exit `4` with `invalid_state` and send no signal, cancelling a retry run cancels its own workflow instead of answering "task not found", and an unknown run is not found

#### harborrag-runtime

- Starting against a control database a newer build already migrated names both schema revisions and how to recover, instead of only "migrations failed"
- The first-start import gives a Jira or Confluence Cloud entry without its email the `api_token` method, instead of the Data Center `pat` method, so a `PUT` of the email fixes it
- Cancelling a run keeps its summary, so the run's `discovered` count no longer drops when it is cancelled
- Reading a run Temporal reports as natively paused shows `paused` instead of failing with `8 is not a valid WorkflowExecutionStatus`
- Pausing a run no longer strands it: a run and its batch are paused by signal only, not natively in Temporal, where a workflow task scheduled at the pause was never dispatched again and resume and cancel hung; the Temporal UI now shows a paused run as `Running`

#### Deployment

- The development API receives `JIRA_EMAIL`, `CONFLUENCE_EMAIL`, `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID`, `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL` from `env/.env.connector`, so the first-start import no longer stores the Jira, Confluence and SharePoint connections without them and with status `error`
- The SharePoint entry of `config/sources/connectors.yaml` crawls the drive with the shared file type list instead of a test folder of Markdown files

## [2.0.0a2] - 2026-10-26

Stored data is not migrated from 2.0.0a1: back up the control database and re-ingest every
source. Follow the [upgrade guide](docs/users/upgrading.md) before upgrading; entries marked
**Breaking** need action.

## [2.0.0a1] - 2026-08-27

This is the first public HarborRAG 2.0 alpha release. Python package metadata,
